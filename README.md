# Minecraft Acclimatize

A comprehensive and highly-configurable body temperature system for Minecraft. This mod adds realistic temperature mechanics to the game, challenging players to manage their body heat in different environments. Originally forked from [*Thermite*](https://github.com/Sparkierkan7/thermite_mod) by [Sparkierkan7](https://github.com/Sparkierkan7), *Acclimatize* expands on its foundation with extended configurability, rewritten block and item handling, and drastically increased compatibility with other mods.

## Features

### Core Temperature System
- **Body Temperature Mechanics**: Experience a realistic temperature system that requires balancing your heat level
- **Variable Acclimatization**: The rate of temperature gain around a heat source can be higher than walking out in the open for improved player enjoyment
- **Environmental Effects**: Temperature changes based on biomes, time of day, and weather, even including indoor/outdoor detection
- **Temperature-Based Effects**: Suffer from hypothermia in cold environments or hyperthermia in hot ones through status effects (not just basic player damage)
- **Status Effects**: Cold and heat resistance effects to temporarily protect against temperature extremes

### Temperature Sources
- **Biome Temperature**: Each biome has a base temperature affecting the player
- **Block Temperature**: Heating blocks (fireplaces, lava, campfires) and cooling blocks (ice, snow) affect nearby players
- **Temperature Falloff**: Heat sources have configurable falloff based on distance
- **Thermal Clothing**: Wear different materials to insulate against cold or heat
- **Customizable Wool Lining**: Add wool to leather armor for additional insulation (ported from *Thermite*)

### Items and Blocks
- **Thermometer**: Check your current temperature and environmental factors
- **Ice Water**: Drinkable item that provides temporary cold resistance
- **Golden Sweet Berries**: Food with temperature-related effects
- **Wool Cloth**: Crafting material to improve armor insulation
- **Brick Fireplace**: Decorative heating block to warm your home
- **Ice Box**: A cooling block with three stages (empty, freezing, frozen)

### Weather and Seasons
- **Wind System**: Configurable wind that affects temperature and can be visualized with particles
- **Optional Seasons**: Seasonal temperature variations with configurable duration
- **Weather Integration**: Option for season-dependent weather patterns

### HUD and Visual Feedback
- **Temperature Display**: Configurable HUD element showing current body temperature
- **Temperature Vignette**: Visual effects indicating when you're too hot or cold
- **Wind Particles**: Optional particles showing wind direction and intensity
- **Glass Thermometer**: Visual representation of your current temperature

## Configuration

The mod offers extensive configuration options through a user-friendly in-game interface (requires Cloth Config and Mod Menu) or via `/<root>/configs/acclimatize.json5` in the game directory.

- **Temperature Thresholds**: Set your own thresholds for hypothermia and hyperthermia
- **Damage Settings**: Configure how much damage temperature extremes cause
- **Block Temperature**: Add or modify blocks that affect temperature
- **Item Temperature**: Configure how armor and held items affect temperature
- **Material Properties**: Set temperature values for different armor materials
- **HUD Customization**: Adjust the position and style of temperature display
- **Environmental Factors**: Configure wind, seasons, and biome temperatures

## Mod Compatibility

*Acclimatize* is designed to be compatible with many other mods:

- **Block Auto-Detection**: The mod can automatically handle modded blocks with heat or cold properties
- **Material Auto-Assignment**: Temperature values can be automatically assigned to armor from other mods
- **Configurable Compatibility**: Add specific modded items and blocks to the temperature system via configs
- **Built-in Support**: Default configuration includes support for:
  - Hardcore Torches
  - Farmer's Delight
  - Refurbished Furniture
  - Various armor material mods
